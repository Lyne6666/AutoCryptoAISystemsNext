# AutoCryptoAISystemsNext

## Description

A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) library implemented in Rust, optimized for embedded systems using a novel combination of precomputed lookup tables and custom elliptic curve arithmetic for efficient verification on resource-constrained devices.

## Features

- Integrates a recurrent neural network for predicting cryptocurrency price movements with a 90-day horizon.
- Employs federated learning across decentralized nodes to train AI models without centralizing user data.
- Utilizes a dynamic portfolio rebalancing algorithm based on reinforcement learning to optimize risk-adjusted returns.
- Implements a secure enclave for storing sensitive API keys and cryptographic credentials using Intel SGX.
- Provides automated trading strategy backtesting with historical data and customizable risk parameters.
- Generates explainable AI (XAI) reports detailing the reasoning behind each trading decision using SHAP values.
- Supports hardware acceleration for computationally intensive tasks like model training using CUDA-enabled GPUs.
- Deploys a distributed message queue using Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and asynchronous communication between system components.
